"Not all links are created equal"
The Page Rank of a page recursively depends on the Page Rank metric of all pages that link to it Pages ranked by Inlink count, and pages ranked by Page Ranked occur at at different ranks
Some pages which do not have high inlink count appear in the Page Rank like (meteorology,china,temperature, European_union,India)
Some pages with higher in-link count do not appear in Page Rank like (wind,extra tropical_cyclone, Poland)
This suggests that even though a page might have higer inlink count it might always not be of good quality

While it may seem plausible that if many pages point to a page P, Then P is a 'good' page.
However, some pages are more important than other this distinction is done by Page Rank algorithm.
Although pagerank may be directly propotional to that of its in-links, but pagerank also factors the following qualities like
- Link from an important page may be more important than a link from a unimportant link 
- Link from different domain account to higher score than  than link from same domain 

This might actually result in two distinctions :
- The page may contain less number of inlinks,but it has popular/quality links pointing to it, results in the pagerank of the links to be high or good. 
- A page may have very large inlink count, but all these inlinks may not be popular and thus will be low pagerank scores.
Thus using pagerank we might be able to avoid pages that have high inlink count but have poor quality or spam but might pop up due to large number of 
spurious links that point to a page where as pagerank might identify the spurious links and identify the page as spam and might not give it a higher rank.
Even though page "wind" might have higher inlink count it is over taken by pages like "india" "meterology" "china" since more high quality links point to this 
page.Likewise, pages like integrated_authority_file national_diet_library even though may have lower inlink count are ranked higher since they are popular and 
have many popular links pointing to them.
